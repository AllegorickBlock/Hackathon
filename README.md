# Hackatonn - Paul (April 2018)
For the Hackaton's week-end  
  
A voice synthesizer instant messenger.  
  
Instant messaging made in C # under Unity.  
  
This messaging transforms all received messages into visual interphase to have an interlocutor and eventually read on the lips.  
For now the avatar is in 2D but the algorithm would allow to do it in 3D more easily.
